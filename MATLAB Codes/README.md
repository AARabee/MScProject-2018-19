* NB: The tolerence of convergence needs to be a small enough number (e.g. 10<sup>-6</sup>). However, this is extremely time-consuming in some programmes. Therefore, the tolerence value in some of the MATLAB programmes is set to a relatively larger number for faster running speed although it's not scientifically rigorous. Note in some cases a larger tolerence will lead to wrong results, and the original smaller tolerence value must be used.
