* NB: The tolerence of convergence should be a small enough number (e.g. 10<sup>-6</sup>). However, this is very time-consuming in some programmes. Therefore, the tolerence sometimes is set to a relatively larger number for faster speed (Note in some cases a larger tolernce will leads to wrong results).
