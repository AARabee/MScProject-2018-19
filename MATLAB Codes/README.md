* NB: The tolerence of convergence should be a small enough number (e.g. 10<sup>-6</sup>). However, this is very time-consuming in some programmes. Therefore, the tolerence is sometimes set to a relatively larger number for faster running speed (Note in some cases a larger tolernce will lead to wrong results, and the original smaller tolerence value must be used).
