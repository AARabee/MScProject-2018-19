* NB: The tolerance of convergence needs to be a small enough number (e.g. 10<sup>-6</sup>). However, this is extremely time-consuming in some programmes. Therefore, the tolerance value in some of the MATLAB programmes is set to a relatively larger number for faster running speed although it's not scientifically rigorous. Note in some cases a larger tolerance will lead to wrong results, and the original smaller tolerance value must be used.
