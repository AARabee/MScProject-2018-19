* NB: High Performance Computing (HPC) is used for the project as CVX toolbox is time-consuming and 100 random channel realizations are needed for most of the simulations. HPC service is provided by Imperial [Research Computing Service](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/research-support/rcs/). Some useful websites: [Getting started with HPC](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/research-support/rcs/support/getting-started/) and [how to run a large number of jobs](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/research-support/rcs/computing/high-throughput-computing/job-sizing/).
